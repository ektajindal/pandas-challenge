I have done lot of analysis on the PyCitySchools data
By calculating scores by size, we can conclude below:
School with large number of students have lesser average math, reading scores and lesser % math, reading and overall passing as compared to schools with less number of students (upto 2000)
By calculating scores by school Type, we can conclude below: 
Charter schools have more reading and math scores and also more % percentages (reading, math and overall). We can conclude that Charter schools are performing better than distrcit schools.
